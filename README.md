A light mod with a funny name and a focus on extending Surge-alloy technology, adds a few unique turrets and production buildings with (what I think are) some interesting mechanics.

Made for Serpulo, the mod has integration for/works well with blocks like the tsunami and wave, so try and find some usecases, turret combos, and whatnot.

Reports on bugs, balancing issues, or simply suggestions are very much welcome.
